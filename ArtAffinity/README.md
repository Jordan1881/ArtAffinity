## Design Philosophy

The platform follows a minimalist, gallery-inspired design approach:
- Monochrome color scheme (black, white, and grey tones)
- Clean, spacious layout emphasizing artwork
- Modern typography using Inter, Quicksand, Nunito, or Poppins font families
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Subtle animations and transitions
- Focus on content and user experience
- Custom SVG logo and favicon for consistent branding

## Technical Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS Variables and Flexbox/Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Responsive Design
- Progressive Enhancement

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. No build process or dependencies required for the demo

## Demo Data

All artist and artwork data, including images, are sample/demo content for demonstration purposes. You can easily replace or expand the data in the `assets/` folder and the sample arrays in `js/main.js`.

## Logo & Favicon
